About the project:
    A painting project where you can change the brush shape and size, and draw on a canvas. Extra features I added were a draw flower button, which draws an image of a flower, as well as a rainbow brush button, that paints a gradient of a rainbow as you move the brush. To revert back to a regular brush, press the rainbow brush button again.

    Claude.ai: Only used one chat titled "green file name meaning", where I initially screenshotted my VS Code workspace to file issue for me. Then, I used this same chat for the whole assignment to assist me in fixing all the bugs in my code throughout the process, as well as help me fix my draw flower function and make my rainbow brush feature.
